## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet, including storage, servers, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. It allows for flexible resources, cost savings, and efficient scalability.

## AWS (Amazon Web Services)

AWS is Amazon's comprehensive and evolving cloud computing platform that includes a mixture of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and packaged Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings.

## Other Main Cloud Service Providers

- Microsoft Azure: A comprehensive suite of cloud services for building, deploying, and managing applications through Microsoft-managed data centers.

- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): A suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, like Google Search and YouTube.

- IBM Cloud: A set of cloud computing services for businesses offered by IBM. It combines platform as a service (PaaS) with infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

- Oracle Cloud: A cloud computing service offered by Oracle Corporation providing servers, storage, network, applications and services through a global network of Oracle Corporation managed data centers.

## IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS

- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides the infrastructure such as virtual machines and other resources like virtual-machine disk image library, block and file-based storage, firewalls, load balancers, IP addresses, virtual local area networks etc.

- PaaS (Platform as a Service): This is used for applications, and other development, while providing cloud components to software. This includes development tools, database management, business intelligence (BI) services, etc.

- SaaS (Software as a Service): In this service model, the cloud-based applications are provided to the user, as a service on demand. It is a single instance of the service running on the cloud and multiple end users are serviced.

- On-premises IT infrastructure is like owning a car. When you buy a car, you’re responsible for its maintenance, and upgrading means buying a new car.

- IaaS is like leasing a car. When you lease a car, you choose the car you want and drive it wherever you wish, but the car isn’t yours. Want an upgrade? Just lease a different car!

- PaaS is like taking a taxi. You don’t drive a taxi yourself, but simply tell the driver where you need to go and relax in the back seat.

- SaaS is like going by bus. Buses have assigned routes, and you share the ride with other passengers.

## Differences Between Public Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Private Cloud

- Public Cloud: Services are delivered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Resources are shared among multiple users and accessible over the internet.

- Private Cloud: Computing resources are used exclusively by a single business or organization. The private cloud can be physically located at the organization's on-site datacenter or hosted by a third-party service provider.

- Hybrid Cloud: This is a combination of a private cloud combined with the use of public cloud services. This model allows for more flexibility and data deployment options.

## Cloud Usage by Industry/Business

- Public Cloud: Used by industries that need to scale rapidly and cost-effectively, such as startups, educational institutions, and businesses with variable computational needs like e-commerce.
- Private Cloud: Preferred by industries that require a high level of data security and privacy, such as government agencies, financial institutions, and healthcare organizations.
- Hybrid Cloud: Used by businesses that need a balance of the scalability of public cloud and the security of private cloud, such as large enterprises with diverse IT needs.

## Operating Expenditure (OpEx) and Capital Expenditure (CapEx)
- OpEx (Operating Expenditure): These are the expenses a business incurs through its normal business operations, often accounted for in the period they were incurred (e.g., rent, utilities, and salaries).
- CapEx (Capital Expenditure): These are funds used by a company to acquire or upgrade physical assets such as property, buildings, an industrial plant, technology, or equipment.

## Cloud and Expenditure Preference
- The preference between OpEx and CapEx depends on the company's financial and operational strategy.

- Cloud computing typically allows businesses to shift from CapEx to OpEx because instead of investing heavily upfront in physical infrastructure (CapEx), they can pay for IT resources on a consumption basis as an operational expense (OpEx).

## Case Studies on Cloud Adoption

- Netflix: By migrating to AWS, Netflix has been able to add numerous streaming services.

- Capital One: The financial firm has migrated most of its workloads to AWS, closing several data centers.
